    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>The dish is exclusively made by S≈çma from Food Wars, combined with the Japanese original dish, the Chaliapin Steak and the donburi concept for his first Shokugeki.<br>
         Although the dish was made with cheap ingredients that can be found in a supermarket, the dish focused on both innovation and balance of the ingredients to fulfill the donburi mantra, "Dons are completed in one bowl." <a href="https://shokugekinosoma.fandom.com/wiki/Chaliapin_Steak_Don">(source)</a></p>

    <ul>Ingredients
        <li>Beef Sirloin</li>
        <li>Lots of Onion</li>
        <li>Garlic</li>
        <li>Pepper</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
        <li>Potato starch</li>
        <li>Rice</li>
        <li>Umeboshi Paste</li>

        <br>For sauce:
            <li>Red Wine</li>
            <li>Soy Sauce</li>
            <li>Butter</li>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <ol>Steps
        <li>Chop the onions finely.</li>
        <li>Remove the tendons from the beef and beat it with a meat tenderizer until as flat as possible.</li>
        <li>Cover meat on both sides with the chopped onion and leave for 30 minutes or more. Remove the onion and add salt and pepper.</li>
        <li>Cook the steak to your preference(most would prefer medium-rare).<br>
             Remove from heat and melt 1 tablespoon of butter in a frying pan and fry the onion used for the beef until it changes color. Adjust the flavor with salt and pepper, then move the onion to the steak.</li>
        <li>Melt the remaining butter in the frying pan and fry the sides of the meat before taking it out.</li>

        <br>Making the sauce
        <li>Add red wine to the frying pan used for the beef to deglaze it. Boil down the wine while scraping off the meat juice.</li>
        <li>Add soy sauce and mix with everything. Adjust seasonings to personal preferences.</li>
        <li>Thicken with dissolved potato starch.        </li>

    </ol>
